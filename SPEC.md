# SPEC.md -- Food Waste Estimation System

**Project**: Single-Task Dual-Stream CNN for Automated Food Waste Estimation Using EfficientNet-B0
**Reference paper**: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0320426
**Dataset**: LeFoodSet -- 524 usable samples, 34 food categories (678 rows in Excel; 154 skipped automatically due to missing segmented images)
**Environment**: Local (CPU/GPU) and Google Colab Pro (T4 GPU). The full project folder is stored on Google Drive and mounted in Colab, so all relative paths (`data/`, `checkpoints/`, `results/`) work identically in both environments.
**Package manager**: `uv` for local development, `pip` for Colab.

## 1. Problem Statement

Estimate the weight of food remaining after eating (in grams) from a pair of segmented images taken before and after a meal. The system replaces subjective visual scoring by hospital dietitians with an objective, reproducible measurement, and must outperform the human visual observer baseline (MAE = 0.0926).

The core difficulty is that weight is not directly visible: two plates can look similar but weigh very differently due to density and height differences. This is solved by predicting a ratio instead of raw grams.

## 2. Inputs & Outputs

### Inputs (at inference)

| Input          | Type    | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Before image   | JPG/PNG | Segmented food image before eating (black background)        |
| After image    | JPG/PNG | Segmented food image after eating (black background)         |
| weight_before  | float   | Known serving weight in grams (optional; enables gram output)|

### Outputs

| Output                  | Type  | Range   | Description                                      |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| consumption_ratio (r)   | float | 0.0-1.0 | Fraction of serving weight remaining after eating|
| weight_after_grams      | float | >= 0    | Denormalized: r * weight_before (if provided)    |
| leftover_grams          | float | >= 0    | (1 - r) * weight_before (if provided)            |

**Denormalization formula**: `w_after_hat = r_hat * w_before`

This cancels out portion size so the model judges only what fraction of the plate remains, which is visible from the images. The before image acts as the reference for the after image.

## 3. Data Pipeline

### 3.1 Metadata Loading (`src/dataset.py`)

```
Load data_original.xlsx
Compute: Weight Leftover (g) = Weight Before Eaten (g) - Weight After Eaten (g)
Validate: assert no negative leftover weights
Filter: skip rows where segmented images are missing from disk
Compute target: consumption_ratio = Weight_After / Weight_Before, clipped to [0, 1]
Compute group: food category name (used by GroupKFold)
Save: normalization_params.json (records target formula)
```

### 3.2 Image Loading

- Images are in subfolders within `data_before/` and `data_after/`
- Use recursive file search (`os.walk`) to find files by filename
- Load segmented versions (black background), NOT raw images
- Raise FileNotFoundError if segmented image is missing; do not fall back to raw

### 3.3 Area Ratio Feature

The area ratio is a scalar feature computed from the segmentation masks:

```python
area_ratio = count_nonblack_pixels(after_seg) / count_nonblack_pixels(before_seg)
area_ratio = clip(area_ratio, 0.0, 1.0)
```

This gives the model a direct visual measure of how much of the plate is still covered with food, complementing the CNN features.

### 3.4 Transforms

```python
# Applied identically to both before and after images using same random seed
train_transform = Compose([
    Resize((224, 224)),
    RandomHorizontalFlip(p=1/7),
    RandomVerticalFlip(p=1/7),
    RandomRotation(degrees=15, p=1/7),
    RandomPadding(p=1/7),
    GaussianBlur(p=1/7),
    RandomAdjustSharpness(p=1/7),
    RandomApply([ColorJitter(contrast=0.5)], p=1/7),
    ToTensor(),
    Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])

val_transform = Compose([
    Resize((224, 224)),
    ToTensor(),
    Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])
```

### 3.5 Dataset Class (`FoodWasteDataset`)

```python
class FoodWasteDataset(Dataset):
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return {
            'before':            tensor,   # (3, 224, 224)
            'after':             tensor,   # (3, 224, 224)
            'area_ratio':        float,    # non-black pixel fraction after/before
            'consumption_ratio': float,    # 0.0-1.0 regression target
            'weight_before':     float,    # serving weight in grams
            'weight_after':      float,    # actual after weight in grams
            'food_name':         str,      # human-readable label
        }
```

## 4. Model Architecture (`src/model.py`)

### 4.1 Dual-Stream EfficientNet-B0 (Single-Task)

```
Before image (3,224,224) -> EfficientNet-B0 -> feat_before (1280,)
After  image (3,224,224) -> EfficientNet-B0 -> feat_after  (1280,)
                                    |
            |feat_before - feat_after| -> diff (1280,)
                                    |
  concat([feat_before, feat_after, diff, area_ratio]) -> (3841,)
                                    |
              FC(3841->1024) + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
              FC(1024->512)  + ReLU + Dropout(0.2)
                                    |
                   FC(512->1) + clamp(0, 1)  [bias init: 0.4]
                                    |
                    consumption_ratio r  (0-1)
```

### 4.2 Weight Sharing

- Both streams share the same EfficientNet-B0 backbone (Siamese-style)
- Pretrained on ImageNet; backbone is frozen for the first 10 epochs (`--frozen_epochs`), then unfrozen with scheduler reset

### 4.3 Loss Function

```python
loss = nn.HuberLoss(delta=0.1)(pred_ratio, true_ratio)
```

Huber loss is less sensitive to outliers than MSE and does not compress gradients near 0 and 1 like pure MAE. Delta = 0.1 keeps it nearly MAE-shaped across the bimodal ratio distribution.

---

## 5. Training Pipeline (`src/train.py`)

### 5.1 Cross Validation

```
- 10-fold outer GroupKFold grouped by food category (1/10 test, 9/10 trainval)
- 5-fold inner GroupKFold on trainval (first split: ~20% val, ~70% train)
  -> final split per fold: 70% train / 20% val / 10% test
- prevents the same food type appearing in both train and test within a fold
- Save fold indices to results/fold_indices.json
- Fix seeds: random=42, numpy=42, torch=42, cuda deterministic=True
```

### 5.2 Sample Weighting

The consumption ratio distribution is bimodal (plates near 0 or near 1). To counteract this:

```python
# Bin ratios into n_bins buckets; weight = 1 / bin_frequency
sample_weights = compute_class_weights(train_df, n_bins=10)
sampler = WeightedRandomSampler(sample_weights, num_samples=len(sample_weights))
```

### 5.3 Training Loop Per Fold

```
For each fold:
    1. Initialize fresh model (EfficientNet-B0 pretrained)
    2. Freeze backbone, train fusion + head for 10 epochs (--frozen_epochs)
    3. Unfreeze all, train with Adam lr=0.0001
    4. ReduceLROnPlateau: factor=0.5, patience=5, min_lr=1e-6
    5. EarlyStopping: patience=20 epochs on val MAE
    6. Save best checkpoint: checkpoints/fold_{n}_best.pth
    7. Log per epoch: train_loss, val_loss, val_mae, val_rmse, lr
```

### 5.4 Checkpointing

```python
checkpoint = {
    'fold': fold_n,
    'epoch': epoch,
    'model_state_dict': model.state_dict(),
    'optimizer_state_dict': optimizer.state_dict(),
    'val_mae': best_val_mae,
    'normalization_params': norm_params,   # contains target formula
}
torch.save(checkpoint, f'checkpoints/fold_{fold_n}_best.pth')
```

### 5.5 Results

```
After all folds:
- Compute mean +/- std of MAE, RMSE across folds
- Compare against human baseline MAE = 0.0926
- Save: results/summary.json
- Save: results/fold_{n}_log.csv (per fold)
- Save: results/all_folds_log.csv (combined)
```

## 6. Segmentation Pipeline (`src/segmentation.py`)

Converts a raw food photo into the ground-truth segmented format required by the model.

### 6.1 Output Format

```
black background (outside plate) | pure white plate area | food at original colors
```

The model was trained on images in this exact format. Inference on raw images must go through
this pipeline to produce compatible inputs.

### 6.2 Algorithm

**Stage 1 -- Plate boundary detection (SAM ViT-B)**
1. Pad raw image (shorter dimension) to square with black pixels
2. Resize to 800x800
3. Run SAM ViT-B with explicit point prompts:
   - Foreground point: center of frame (plate is always centered, fixed hospital camera)
   - Background points: four corners at 10% inset (always the checkered mat)
4. Select the highest-scoring mask from SAM's three candidates
5. Morphological closing (30px kernel) to fill small gaps in the mask

**Stage 2 -- Plate normalization (HSV + local texture)**
6. Within the SAM mask, classify each pixel using HSV and local texture std (7x7 window):
   - Plate surface: S < 40 AND V > 150 AND texture_std < 12 -> (255, 255, 255)
   - Food: all other pixels inside the mask -> original RGB preserved
7. Outside the mask -> (0, 0, 0)

The texture criterion prevents white/cream foods (rice, porridge) from being painted white:
smooth plate surface has local std ~3-8; rice grain boundaries have local std ~10-20.

### 6.3 Dish Shape Handling

SAM with point prompts is shape-agnostic: it detects the plate boundary directly from the
image content without any geometric assumption. Both dish types in the dataset are handled:
- **Round circular plate** (most categories)
- **Large rounded-rectangle plate** (cat 007, some cat 033)

### 6.4 CLI Usage

```bash
# Single image
python src/segmentation.py --input data/raw/data_before/001/001_001_DSC_0059_bef.JPG \
    --output results/seg_test.jpg

# Batch (walks subdirectories, writes flat into output_dir)
python src/segmentation.py --input_dir data/raw/data_before --output_dir data/segmented/data_before
```

### 6.5 Known Limitations

- SAM assumes the dish occupies the center of the frame. Only valid for the fixed hospital cafeteria camera setup; images from a different angle may require different prompts.
- White/cream foods (rice, rice porridge, white tofu) with very smooth texture may still be partially normalized to white if their local texture std falls below the threshold of 12. This is the documented hard case from the paper.
- SAM checkpoint (~375 MB, ViT-B) is downloaded automatically to `~/.cache/segment_anything/` on first use. Subsequent runs use the cached file. On Google Colab, this cache does not persist between sessions -- add the download step to the Colab setup cell.

## 7. Inference Pipeline (`src/inference.py` + `notebooks/LeFoodSet_Leftovers_Inference.ipynb`)

### 6.1 Single Prediction

```python
def predict(before_path, after_path, checkpoint_path, weight_before_g=None):
    # Compute area_ratio from pixel counts
    # Load model, apply val_transform, forward pass
    # r_hat = model(before, after, area_ratio)
    # Denormalize if weight_before_g provided:
    #   w_after_hat = r_hat * weight_before_g
    #   leftover_g  = (1 - r_hat) * weight_before_g
    return {'consumption_ratio': r_hat, ...}
```

### 6.2 Ensemble Inference

- Load all 5 fold checkpoints
- Average r_hat across folds; report mean +/- std

## 9. Out of Scope

- Training a separate segmentation model (segmented images already provided)
- Food category classification (single-task design)
- Web or mobile deployment
- Real-time video inference
- Foods outside the 34 LeFoodSet categories
- 3D volume estimation

---

## 10. End-to-End Verification

The system is working correctly when:

1. `LeFoodSet_Leftovers_Training.ipynb` runs all 10 folds without interruption. On Colab, Drive is mounted and the working directory is set to the project folder before execution, so checkpoints persist automatically.
2. Final mean MAE across folds is < 0.0926
3. `LeFoodSet_Leftovers_Inference.ipynb` accepts two image uploads and an optional serving weight, and returns a consumption ratio and predicted grams within 3 seconds
4. Results are reproducible: running training twice with the same seeds produces identical fold metrics
